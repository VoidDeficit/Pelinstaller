### ⚠️ Pelican is in beta so this script may not work if breaking changes are made, this script will also be recoded to use Docker Compose in the coming days :construction:

Welcome to the Pelinstaller repository! This installer is a hard fork of [ForestRacks's Pterodactyl Installer](https://github.com/ForestRacks/PteroInstaller) and is specifically designed for people to easily install and set up the Pelican on Debian-based or RHEL-based machines. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, post an issue on our GitHub repository for assistance.

Learn more about [Pelican's Project](https://pelican.dev/) here. This script is a third-party utility and not associated with the official Pelican Project.

## Using the installation scripts

To use the installation scripts, simply run this command as root. The script will ask you whether you would like to install just the panel, just Wings or both.

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zinidia/Pelinstaller/Production/install.sh || wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zinidia/Pelinstaller/Production/install.sh) auto
```

_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._

⚠️ Warning: There is currently an issue where Pelican creates files owned by the wrong Linux user when specific features on the admin panel are enabled. To resolve this, you may have to adjust the permissions by running the following command: `chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pelican`. For more details, check Pelican's [troubleshooting guide](https://pelican.dev/docs/troubleshooting/).

Here is a [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8UJhyUFoHM) that illustrates the installation process.

## Features

- Automatic installation of the Pelican Panel (dependencies, database, cronjob, nginx).
- Automatic installation of the Pelican Wings (Docker, systemd).
- Panel: (optional) automatic configuration of Let's Encrypt.
- Panel: (optional) automatic configuration of firewall.
- Uninstallation support for both panel and wings.

_\* Indicates an operating system and release that previously was supported by this script._

## Firewall setup

The installation scripts can install and configure a firewall for you. The script will ask whether you want this or not. It is highly recommended to opt-in for the automatic firewall setup.

## Production & Ops

### Creating a release

In `install.sh` github source and script release variables should change every release. Firstly, update the `CHANGELOG.md` so that the release date and release tag are both displayed. No changes should be made to the changelog points themselves. Secondly, update `GITHUB_SOURCE` and `SCRIPT_RELEASE` in `install.sh`. Finally, you can now push a commit with the message `Release vX.Y.Z`. Create a release on GitHub. See [this commit](https://github.com/pelican-installer/pelican-installer/commit/90aaae10785f1032fdf90b216a4a8d8ca64e6d44) for reference.
